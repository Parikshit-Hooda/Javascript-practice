- var -> function scoped. variable declared with var is visible everywhere inside the function its declared in.
- let -> block scoped. variable declared with let is visible everywhere inside the block its declared in. A let variable can only be declared once, defined multiple times.
- const -> block scoped. variable declared with const is visible everywhere inside the block its declared in. A const variable can only be declared once. Value has to be assigned at the time of declaration.
